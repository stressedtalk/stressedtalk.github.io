## Ingredients

### Choux pastry:
250ml (8 fl oz) Water
125g (4¼ oz) Butter
125g (4¼ oz) Plain flour
&frac14;	Teaspoon salt
4 Eggs

### Filling:
450ml (16 fl oz) Double cream
1 Tablespoon caster sugar
&frac12; Teaspoon vanilla extract

### Topping:
75g (3 oz) Plain chocolate

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 230 C / Gas mark 8.
2. In a medium saucepan, bring water to the boil. Add butter and stir as it melts, then return to the boil. Add flour and salt all at once and stir vigorously until mixture forms a ball.
3. Remove from heat and add eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each egg until smooth. Spoon the choux pastry in heaped tablespoons, 7cm apart, on a baking tray.
4. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven then reduce heat to 160 C / Gas mark 3 and bake for 25 more minutes. Don't be tempted to open the oven door as this may cause them to flop.
5. Remove profiteroles from the oven, split and remove soft dough from the centre. Turn the oven off and return pastries to dry in the cooling oven, 20 minutes more.
6. Cool completely on the wire rack.
7. **For Filling:** In a medium bowl, whip cream with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Stir in vanilla and sugar. Fill profiteroles with whipped cream.
8. **For Topping:** Melt chocolate in the microwave or slowly over low heat. Drizzle melted chocolate over tops of profiteroles. Serve immediately.
