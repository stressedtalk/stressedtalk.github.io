<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<h3 id="sponge-pudding">Sponge Pudding:</h3>
<p>175g Self-raising flour Pinch of ground cinnamon Pinch of salt 50g Caster sugar 75g Shredded suet or coarsely grated chilled butter 75g Currants Finely grated zest of ½ lemon 1 Egg, lightly beaten 5 Tablespoon semi-skimmed milk</p>
<h3 id="lemon-syrup">Lemon Syrup:</h3>
<p>4 Tablespoon golden syrup Finely grated zest of ½ lemon 2 Tablespoon lemon juice</p>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sift the flour, cinnamon and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar and the suet or butter, followed by the currants and lemon zest.</li>
<li>Make a well in the middle, add the egg and the milk and mix to a soft dropping consistency, adding a little more milk if needed.</li>
<li>Line the base of a well-greased 1 litre pudding basin with a circle of greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture.</li>
<li>Place a double thickness of greaseproof paper, pleated in the centre, over the pudding, then tie securely with string. (The pleat allows room for the pudding to rise.)</li>
<li>Put the basin on a trivet or an upturned saucer in a saucepan and pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the basin.</li>
<li>Cover the pan and steam for 1 3/4 hours, topping up with boiling water as necessary. (Alternatively, the pudding can be baked, uncovered at 180°C/gas 4 for 1 hour or until well-risen.</li>
<li>Cover with foil towards the end of cooking if the pudding is browning too much.)</li>
<li>When the pudding is almost cooked, make the lemon syrup. Put the golden syrup, lemon zest and juice in a small saucepan and gently heat, stirring occasionally until the mixture just begins to bubble. Turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Remove the basin from the pan and ease round the edge of the pudding with a round-bladed knife to loosen it.</li>
<li>Turn out onto a warmed plate, then pour the hot lemon syrup over the top.</li>
<li>Serve cut into wedges.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If using grated butter, chill it first in the freezer for about 20 minutes, then hold the end in a piece of foil while grating, to prevent it melting with the warmth of your hand. To microwave, leave uncovered and cook on full power at 650 watts for about 5 minutes (depending on the power of your microwave oven). Leave to stand for 3–4 minutes before turning out. To check if it is cooked through, a cocktail stick inserted in the middle should come out clean.</p>
