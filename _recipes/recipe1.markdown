# Treacle Tart

If you have a sweet tooth, then treacle tart is the one for you. The tart can be served as a pudding with custard or a dollop of cream. Alternatively, serve a slice with afternoon tea, or simply as a treat with a cup of tea. This may be a rich dessert but don't worry because you only need a small slice to enjoy the delicious taste. You will not be sorry.

## Ingredients

### For the Shortcrust Pastry:		
- 100g Plain flour					
- 50g Butter					
- 1 Teaspoon sugar
- Pinch of salt
- A little water

### For the Filling:
- 4 Tablespoons golden syrup
- 3 Thick slices white bread (crusts removed)

## Method

1. Make the pastry by mixing the flour, sugar and salt together and rubbing the butter into the dry mix. Once the mix resembles breadcrumbs, add a little cold water under the dough until it is  smooth but not sticky. Then roll it into a ball and place it in a bowl in the fridge for 30 minutes.
2. During this time, preheat the oven at 200°C.
3. **For Filling:** Prepare the tart filling by making small chunks out of the white bread slices and place them into a large bowl. Add golden syrup and stir until the mixture is smooth.
4. Once the pastry has been in the fridge for 30 minutes, take it out and roll it out onto a flat floured surface until it is able to fit into a 25cm tart tin.
5. Pour the Golden Syrup mix into the tart tin and place in the oven at 200°C for 20 minutes and then 180°C for 10 minutes.
6. Then take out the oven and tart tin, and cool on a rack. Eat when it has cooled partially or completely.

It will keep for up to 3 days in a cake tin in the fridge.
