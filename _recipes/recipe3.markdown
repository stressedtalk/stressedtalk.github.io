# Bread and Butter Pudding

A traditional British pudding that's comforting and delicious. This simple recipe stays true to the original flavours, but if you're looking for a twist, why not swap the sultanas for currants or chopped, dried apricots, substitute lemon zest for orange or spread coarse marmalade or berry jam over the buttered bread slices.

## Ingredients

- 8 Slices of stale bread (crusts as well), any type
- 2 Eggs
- 425ml (&frac34; pint) of Milk
- Pinch of nutmeg
- Butter
- Dried fruit
- Sugar

## Method

1. Butter the bread (I like to put some butter on both sides of the crusts) and cut into triangles.
2. Grease a casserole dish or deep sided cake tin, and add a layer of buttered bread.
3. Sprinkle with sugar and dried fruit. Repeat layers until all the bread is evenly distributed, then mix the egg and milk and pour over the bread.
4. Press down firmly to compress the pudding and help the bread absorb the milk mixture.
5. Pop in the oven at 180 C / Gas 4 and bake until golden brown and the custard mixture is set. I like to serve this with custard but it goes well with cream, ice cream or on its own.
