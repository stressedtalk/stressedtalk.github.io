## Ingredients

- 100g (4 oz) Caster sugar
- 450ml (16 fl oz) Semi skimmed milk
- 2 Eggs, beaten
- 2 Egg yolks, beaten
- 75g (3 oz) Caster sugar

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180 C / Gas mark 4.
2. In a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat, melt 100g sugar until golden. Carefully pour hot sugar evenly into four ovenproof ramekins or custard cups, tilting cups to coat bottoms evenly.
3. In another saucepan, bring milk just to boil over medium heat. Stir hot milk, a little at a time, into beaten eggs and egg yolks, until well combined. Stir in 75g sugar. Pour milk mixture evenly into ramekins.
4. Line a roasting tin with a damp tea towel. Place ramekins on cloth, inside roasting tin, and place roasting tin on oven rack. Fill roasting tin with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, until set. Let cool, invert onto small plates and serve.
