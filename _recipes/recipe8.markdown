## Ingredients

2 Egg whites
&frac18; Teaspoon cream of tartar
85g (3 oz) Icing sugar
4 Tablespoons desiccated coconut
&frac14; Teaspoon almond extract

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 120 C / Gas mark 1/2.
2. In a small bowl with a mixer at high speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
3. Beating at high speed, gradually sprinkle in sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time, beating until sugar is completely dissolved. Whites should stand in stiff glossy peaks.
4. With a silicone spatula, gently fold in coconut and almond extract until mixed.
5. Drop mixture by rounded teaspoonfuls onto a large baking tray, about 2.5cm (1 in) apart.
6. Bake 1 hour or until dry. Remove to a wire rack to cool.

**Tip**: To keep your meringue from being flat and grainy, try beating egg whites until stiff but not dry. Overbeaten egg whites will lose volume and deflate when folded into other ingredients. Also, when beating in sugar, beat in about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well between each addition. Then beat until meringue is thick, white and glossy. Be absolutely sure not a particle of grease or egg yolk gets into the whites.
