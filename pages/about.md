**Howdy :)**

I'm a third year university student studying a BA in English Literature and Publishing Media at Oxford Brookes University. I have an interest in crime and thriller novels and am always on the look out for new authors to read.

Join me as I try, and fail, to balance my time between work, studying, keeping an active social life and trying to find good internships.

Also on this blog is a selection of budget recipes for the whole family to enjoy. Each recipe costs less than 50p per serving and all ingredients are available at your local shops.
