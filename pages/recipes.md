This is a collection of 10 classic and family favourite desserts that cost less than 50p per serving. Because of the nature of the recipes, they serve between four to twelve, which combined with the own-brand ingredients, means that the cost can be kept down. The size of the recipes, as well as the budget element surrounding the ingredients, means that this recipe book is perfect for a family to use. Or if anyone is trying to save money while still wanting to treat themselves.

The recipes range from the classic apple crumble and rice pudding to more seemingly high-end desserts such as profiteroles and lemon tart. The variety of desserts means that there should be something for everyone, and due to the versatility of these recipes, any ingredients can be substituted. Therefore there is not a need for multiple recipes explaining the same dessert, just differently flavoured.
